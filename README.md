# Seattle airbnb data
by S John Cody



## Dataset and motivation

The Seattle airbnb dataset contains 1.4 million entries relating to listings for airbnb properties in the area of Seattle.
https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data

As both renter or landlord, people are looking to get the best out of property rentals. I look into the data that may 
reveal key clues and trends.

## Files

calendar.csv (1393570 entries, describes availability)

listings.csv (3818 entries, describes individual properties)

reviews.csv (84849 entries, gives renter reviews)

## Summary of Findings

We see in this data, among other things, that the weekly cyclical variations in airbnb bookings diminish through the year 2016, that there are 
two huge drops in availability that may be related to significant events, and that overall availability increases towards the end of the year. There 
is a (very weak) positive association between cancellation policy and average price, and we find the ten words in property summaries most associated 
with higher prices.

## Acknowledgements

Would like to acknowledge airbnb for making this data available.
