## Seattle airbnb

Have you ever wanted to know the relationship between various kinds of information in a large dataset representing the airbnb rental environment in Seattle?

Of course you haven't. It is unlikely that you live in Seattle (only 1% of the US do, assuming you are within the US). I haven't 
even been there.

Nevertheless, you might well have used the highly popular airbnb rental service for accomodation. You may even have considered matters from the other end,
as a property owner seeking to make best use of an empty room.

If so, such information is highly instructive and could make a very real difference, both on the bottom line and in terms of the comfort and convenience of your
lifestyle. There is much we can learn!
