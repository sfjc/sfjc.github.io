## Seattle airbnb

#Have you ever wanted to know the relationship between various kinds of information in a large dataset representing the airbnb rental enviornment in Seattle?

#Of course you haven't. You probably don't even live in Seattle (only 0.05% of people in the world do, and only 1% even restricting the total to US citizens). I haven't 
#even been there.
# Nevertheless, you might well have used the highly popular airbnb rental service for accomodation. You may even have considered matters from the other end,
# as a proporty owner seeking to make best use of an empty room.

# If so, such information is highly instructive and could make a very real difference, both on the bottom line and in the comfort and convenience of your
# lifestyle. There is much we can learn!
