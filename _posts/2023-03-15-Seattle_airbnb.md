## Seattle Airbnb


So... have you ever wanted to know the relationship between various kinds of information in a large dataset representing the Airbnb rental environment in Seattle?

Of course you haven't. It is unlikely that you live in Seattle (only 1% of US citizens do, assuming you are within the US). I haven't 
even been there.

Nevertheless, you might well have used the near-globally popular Airbnb rental service for accomodation. You may even have considered matters from the other end,
as a property owner seeking to make best use of an empty room.

If so, such information is highly instructive and likely widely applicable, and could make a very real difference, both on the bottom line and in terms of the comfort and convenience of your lifestyle. There is much we can learn!

These are the three questions I am posing:

1) Do properties with stricter cancellation policies typically have higher prices?

2) How does the number of available properties vary through the year? Is it cyclical? Is there an overall trend?

3) Are there any particular words in the property summaries associated with higher prices?


First, let's look at whether properties with stricter cancellation properties typically have higher prices.
Airbnb has three categories for cancellation: 'flexible', 'moderate' and 'strict'.

From the data made available by Airbnb on Kaggle,
the answer appears to be yes, there is an association, but the association is a very weak one, with a 'Pearson coefficient' of 0.26.

This means that, as a renter, if you are seeking a property with a higher price, it won't necessarily require you to follow a strict cancellation policy,
although it is more likely to. As a landlord, it means that even if you have a property that doesn't fetch a high price, you can still set strict
cancellation policies without being completely out-of-step with rival properties.
